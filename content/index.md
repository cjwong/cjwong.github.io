## About

Cara J. Wong studies how Americans define their communities and who they
believe deserves public support. Her book *Boundaries of Obligation in American
Politics* (Cambridge University Press) examines how geographic, racial, and
national identities shape these judgments. Recent work, including a 2025 article 
in *BJPS*, investigates how people's perceptions of their local communities affect their political attitudes.

Wong is Professor of Political Science and Asian American Studies at the
University of Illinois, where she is Director of Graduate Studies and Associate Head for Graduate Programs in the Political
Science Department. She is past president of the Political Psychology section of the
American Political Science Association, co-founder of the Politics of Identity
Across Subfields ([PIAS](https://www.alivny.com/community/pias)) at MPSA, and co-founder of the Intergroup Relations
Workshop Network. She has been a fellow at Stanford's [Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences](https://casbs.stanford.edu/) and the [Russell Sage Foundation](https://www.russellsage.org/).
