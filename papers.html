			<p> If ``All politics is local,'' as Tip O'Neill famously stated, then
			understanding politics requires understanding how people and place
			interact. This project deepens our
			knowledge about how ordinary people use information about their
			environments to make decisions about politics in the following ways: It (1) improves the
			measurement of personally relevant places by creating an innovative
			map-drawing computer interface to a large scale survey; (2) clarifies
			the mechanism behind contextual effects by directly
			asking people to describe their environments; and (3) enhances
			our understanding of the causal relationship between place and
			attitudes by adding contextual information to a longitudinal study of
			political attitudes and behaviors. </p>

			<p> For place to matter to an individual, it should to be personal. A
			boundary drawn by the Census or a state political party may contain
			meaningful places for some people, but it is not designed with any
			given individual in mind. Relationships between the characteristics of
			such geographies and individual attitudes and behaviors may be hard to
			interpret because of the heterogeneity in the psychological
			relationships between people and place. This project enhances the
			measurement of individuals' perceptions of their local communities by
			allowing them to draw boundaries of these places on maps; a self-drawn
			map will at least show us what area is personally relevant; and an
			online survey of a sample chosen to maximize variation on the racial
			characteristics (and changes) of people's environments will ask about
			the personal maps as well as about places that group people by
			administrative fiat. </p>

			<p> While mapping allows improves the measurement and meaningfulness of
			observed relationships between place and person, researchers have long
			faced the difficulty of disentangling the fact that people choose to
			live in places based on their beliefs, attitudes, and interests, as
			much as (or perhaps more than) places may change such aspects of
			people. In any given observational cross-section, it is hard to
			differentiate the effects of place from those of selection. This
			project provides a way to address this problem by adding contextual
			information to the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study. In this
			study, a random sample of roughly 900 members of the high school
			graduating class of 1965 were tracked over 33 years of their lives; in
			addition to information about how political attitudes and behavior
			have changed over time, the study contains a record of residential
			mobility. The project will geocode the respondents' residences
			reported over the 33 year period and add information about the
			political, economic and social characteristics of those places to the
			dataset. The longitudinal data on people connected to places will
			allow description of the selection effect in action. These data will
			allow analysts to disentangle the effects of moving to a new place
			from the effects of life-cycle (by comparing similar people of the
			same ages who have and who have not moved). </p>
