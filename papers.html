			<p> If "All politics is local," as Tip O'Neill famously stated, then
			understanding politics requires understanding how people and place
			interact. This project deepens our
			knowledge about how ordinary people use information about their
			environments to make decisions about politics in the following ways: It (1) improves the
			measurement of personally relevant places by creating an innovative
			map-drawing computer interface to large scale surveys; (2) clarifies
			the mechanism behind contextual effects by directly
			asking people to describe their environments; and (3) enhances
			our understanding of the causal relationship between place and
			attitudes by adding contextual information to a longitudinal study of
			political attitudes and behaviors. </p>

			<p> For place to matter to an individual, it should to be personal. A
			boundary drawn by the Census or a state political party may contain
			meaningful places for some people, but it is not designed with any
			given individual in mind. Relationships between the characteristics of
			such geographies and individual attitudes and behaviors may be hard to
			interpret because of the heterogeneity in the psychological
			relationships between people and place. This project enhances the
			measurement of individuals' perceptions of their local communities by
			allowing them to draw boundaries of these places on maps; a self-drawn
			map will at least show us what area is personally relevant; and an
			online survey of a sample chosen to maximize variation on the racial
			characteristics (and changes) of people's environments will ask about
			the personal maps as well as about places that group people by
			administrative fiat. </p>

			<h2  style="color: #1F4096; text-decoration: underline;"> Dying to Belong: Citizenship, Military Service, and Patriotism </h2>
			
			<p> A book project on the meaning and value of citizenship in the United States today. Since before the U.S. was a nation, non-citizens have fought on its behalf and have been granted citizenship (first state and then national) as a result.  Nevertheless, this history is not widely known, despite the fact that these “green-card troops” should hold bipartisan appeal; conservatives who worry about free-riding immigrants should be appeased by these soldiers willing to take on a responsibility that many American-born citizens eschew today, and liberals should favor one of the only ways to speed up a naturalization process that is often described as slow and burdensome.  This policy – which is older and more American than even apple pie and baseball – was rarely discussed in the news in the past, and in recent years tends to appear in stories about naturalization ceremonies for soldiers on the Fourth of July.  These hagiographies seem to assume that service justifies citizenship, without pointing out that it is much more typical for membership to precede duties, rather than the reverse order. </p>
			
			<p> Using national survey data with questions I developed for the 2014 and 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, I show that Americans are ambivalent about allowing noncitizens to serve in the U.S. armed forces, but are willing to grant U.S. citizenship to those who do serve.  I also answer the question of whether other types of service (e.g., serving in the Peace Corps or as a firefighter) are similar, in terms of whether immigrants should be allowed to serve and whether citizenship should be granted for these other types of service.</p>
