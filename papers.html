    <h2>Maps in Their Heads</h2>
<p>If all politics is local, understanding politics requires understanding how people interpret their environments. This project develops new ways to measure personally meaningful places, including map-drawing tools embedded in surveys, and tests how perceptions of place shape political attitudes.</p>

<h2>Dying to Belong: Citizenship, Military Service, and Patriotism</h2>
<p>This book project examines the meaning and value of citizenship today, focusing on the long history of non-citizens who serve in the U.S. armed forces and are granted citizenship. Using national survey data, the project asks when Americans view service as sufficient for membership, and how those views compare across other forms of service.</p>
