			<p> If ``All politics is local,'' as Tip O'Neill famously stated, then
			understanding politics requires understanding how people and place
			interact. This project deepens our
			knowledge about how ordinary people use information about their
			environments to make decisions about politics in the following ways: It (1) improves the
			measurement of personally relevant places by creating an innovative
			map-drawing computer interface to large scale surveys; (2) clarifies
			the mechanism behind contextual effects by directly
			asking people to describe their environments; and (3) enhances
			our understanding of the causal relationship between place and
			attitudes by adding contextual information to a longitudinal study of
			political attitudes and behaviors. </p>

			<p> For place to matter to an individual, it should to be personal. A
			boundary drawn by the Census or a state political party may contain
			meaningful places for some people, but it is not designed with any
			given individual in mind. Relationships between the characteristics of
			such geographies and individual attitudes and behaviors may be hard to
			interpret because of the heterogeneity in the psychological
			relationships between people and place. This project enhances the
			measurement of individuals' perceptions of their local communities by
			allowing them to draw boundaries of these places on maps; a self-drawn
			map will at least show us what area is personally relevant; and an
			online survey of a sample chosen to maximize variation on the racial
			characteristics (and changes) of people's environments will ask about
			the personal maps as well as about places that group people by
			administrative fiat. </p>
