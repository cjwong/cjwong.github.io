			This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their communities and
			the extent to which their communities' boundaries determine who they
			believe should benefit from the government's resources via
			redistributive policies. By contributing extensive empirical analyses
			to a largely theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective
			nature of communities while confronting the elusive task of pinning
			down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper understanding of people's
			definitions of their communities and how they affect feelings of
			duties and obligations provides a new lens through which to look at
			diverse societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and
			humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types of
			communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong finds that the
			decision to help only those within certain borders and ignore the
			needs of those outside rests, to a certain extent, on whether and how
			people translate their sense of community into obligations. </p>
