This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their communities and
the extent to which their communities' boundaries determine who they
believe should benefit from the government's resources via
redistributive policies. By contributing extensive empirical analyses
to a largely theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective
nature of communities while confronting the elusive task of pinning
down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper understanding of people's
definitions of their communities and how they affect feelings of
duties and obligations provides a new lens through which to look at
diverse societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and
humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types of
communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong finds that the
decision to help only those within certain borders and ignore the
needs of those outside rests, to a certain extent, on whether and how
people translate their sense of community into obligations. </p>

<p> <a href="papers/WongEtAll2012.pdf">  Bringing the Person Back In: Boundaries, Perceptions, and the Measurement of Racial Context </a>
Place is sometimes vague or undefined in studies of context, and scholars use a range of Census units to measure ``context.'' In this paper, we borrow from Parsons and Shils to offer a conceptualization of context. This conceptualization, and a recognition of both Lippmann's pseudoenvironments and the statistical Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, lead us to a new measurement strategy.  We propose a map-based measure to capture how ordinary people use information about their environments to make decisions about politics.  Respondents draw their contexts on maps  ---  deciding the boundaries of their relevant environments  ---  and describe their perceptions of the demographic make-up of these contexts. The evidence is clear:  ``pictures in our heads'' do not resemble governmental administrative units in shape or content.  By ``bringing the person back in'' to the measurement of context, we are able to marry psychological theories of information processing with sociological theories of racial threat.
