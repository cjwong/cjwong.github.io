This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their communities and
the extent to which their communities' boundaries determine who they
believe should benefit from the government's resources via
redistributive policies. By contributing extensive empirical analyses
to a largely theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective
nature of communities while confronting the elusive task of pinning
down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper understanding of people's
definitions of their communities and how they affect feelings of
duties and obligations provides a new lens through which to look at
diverse societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and
humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types of
communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong finds that the
decision to help only those within certain borders and ignore the
needs of those outside rests, to a certain extent, on whether and how
people translate their sense of community into obligations. </p>

<p> If ``All politics is local,'' as Tip O'Neill famously stated, then
understanding politics requires understanding how people and place
interact. This project deepens our
knowledge about how ordinary people use information about their
environments to make decisions about politics in the following ways: It (1) improves the
measurement of personally relevant places by creating an innovative
map-drawing computer interface to a large scale survey; (2) clarifies
the mechanism behind contextual effects by directly
asking people to describe their environments; and (3) enhances
our understanding of the causal relationship between place and
attitudes by adding contextual information to a longitudinal study of
political attitudes and behaviors. </p>

<p> For place to matter to an individual, it should to be personal. A
boundary drawn by the Census or a state political party may contain
meaningful places for some people, but it is not designed with any
given individual in mind. Relationships between the characteristics of
such geographies and individual attitudes and behaviors may be hard to
interpret because of the heterogeneity in the psychological
relationships between people and place. This project enhances the
measurement of individuals' perceptions of their local communities by
allowing them to draw boundaries of these places on maps; a self-drawn
map will at least show us what area is personally relevant; and an
online survey of a sample chosen to maximize variation on the racial
characteristics (and changes) of people's environments will ask about
the personal maps as well as about places that group people by
administrative fiat. </p>

<p> While mapping allows improves the measurement and meaningfulness of
observed relationships between place and person, researchers have long
faced the difficulty of disentangling the fact that people choose to
live in places based on their beliefs, attitudes, and interests, as
much as (or perhaps more than) places may change such aspects of
people. In any given observational cross-section, it is hard to
differentiate the effects of place from those of selection. This
project provides a way to address this problem by adding contextual
information to the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study. In this
study, a random sample of roughly 900 members of the high school
graduating class of 1965 were tracked over 33 years of their lives; in
addition to information about how political attitudes and behavior
have changed over time, the study contains a record of residential
mobility. The project will geocode the respondents' residences
reported over the 33 year period and add information about the
political, economic and social characteristics of those places to the
dataset. The longitudinal data on people connected to places will
allow description of the selection effect in action. These data will
allow analysts to disentangle the effects of moving to a new place
from the effects of life-cycle (by comparing similar people of the
same ages who have and who have not moved). </p>

<p> <a href="http://jakebowers.org/PAPERS/WongRacialContext2012.pdf"> Bringing the Person Back In: Boundaries, Perceptions, and the Measurement of Racial Context
<span>
Place is sometimes vague or undefined in studies of context, and scholars use a range of Census units to measure ``context.'' In this paper, we borrow from Parsons and Shils to offer a conceptualization of context. This conceptualization, and a recognition of both Lippmann's pseudoenvironments and the statistical Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, lead us to a new measurement strategy.  We propose a map-based measure to capture how ordinary people use information about their environments to make decisions about politics.  Respondents draw their contexts on maps  ---  deciding the boundaries of their relevant environments  ---  and describe their perceptions of the demographic make-up of these contexts. The evidence is clear:  ``pictures in our heads'' do not resemble governmental administrative units in shape or content.  By ``bringing the person back in'' to the measurement of context, we are able to marry psychological theories of information processing with sociological theories of racial threat.
